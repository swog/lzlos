	Malloc called in a usermode function can return the physical address of the block descriptor. The block
descriptor would hold the physical address of the actual heap. The kernel would change the page table
for the user application to translate the virtual address of the block descriptor to the physical
address of the heap.

	When freeing the heap, the kernel will know exactly where the descriptor is. It would be able to
dereference the heap descriptor using the kernel's identity page table. It could then locate the 
exact physical address and size to free.
